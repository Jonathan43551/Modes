# Modes
Misc modes of primer and vectr for OSM glove sets http://osm.codes/

http://iterati.github.io/vectr.html  (I used an older version of vectr to create these modes, I think it was the february build 2-19-2016)

http://iterati.github.io/primer.html (I used version .91 to create these modes) 

Copy the .light files and open using either vectr/primer, then upload to each chip. I like to run EEPROM clear, then use hexloader for vectr/primer then upload these modes if any of the chips behaves strangely.
